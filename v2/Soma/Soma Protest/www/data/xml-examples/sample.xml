	    <text><![CDATA[A 2006 study suggested plants could account for almost half of the global production of the greenhouse gas.<br/><br/>But a UK-based team now reports that under normal conditions, plants just convey methane from the soil to the air without actually producing it.<br/><br/>Writing in a Royal Society journal, they suggest identifying sources of methane is key for climate control.<br/><br/>The gas is about 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its warming effect.<br/><br/>After remaining stable for almost a decade, there have been signs in the last two years that concentrations have begun to grow again, which according to some observers presages an era of faster-rising temperatures.]]></text>
