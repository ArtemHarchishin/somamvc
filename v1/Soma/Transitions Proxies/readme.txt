The Transition proxies is one of the requirement to start Soma. They are proxy for a tween library, it makes you able to use SomaTween and have only one "interface" to use a tween library.

I wrote 3 of them as example for the most common tween libraries (Tweener, TweenMax, GTween).

Even if it is a requirement to start Soma, the use of SomaTween in your development is optional. Soma centralize transitions via a TransitionsManager, SomaTween and a transitions proxies file. It makes you able to easily debug tween issues, disable time and delay for the whole site or do whatever you need in this Transitions class, but it is up to you to use SomaTween or not.

---------------------------------------

To change a tween library in a site generated by SomaUI:
- add the tween library sources in your source folder (ex: /source/front-end/src/)
- replace the Transitions.as class used by Soma (ex: /source/front-end/src/com/mysite/Transitions.as)

To change change the SomaUI sources and export the site with the Transitions proxy and the tween library you prefer:

- in the SomaUI folder /SomaUI/framework/static-source/source/front-end/src
remove the caurina folder (Tweener) and add the sources of the tween library you wish

- in the SomaUI folder /SomaUI/framework/user-source
replace the Transitions.as class by the one corresponding to your tween library
edit the file and replace the package name by #SOMAUI#-USER_PACKAGE-#SOMAUI#, to get:

package #SOMAUI#-USER_PACKAGE-#SOMAUI# {

SomaUI is then ready to export sites using the tween library of your choice.
